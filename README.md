# ChatGPT-Study-Helper
Prompt for chatGPT to make it act like your personal tutor, that helps you to figure out the solutions by yourself instead of just handing you the solution right away.


This "presentation" is for People with no background in anything Computer related. It has no claim to be 100% technically correct in its explanations. It should give people with no Background a very brief view on what they can do with ChatGPT and why they sometimes need to do things, that are not Intuitive for them.
My advice here is based on my own experiences and findings as a Newbie in this territory, while "playing" with AI.
I tried to show some things you can do with ChatGPT and give an insight on how I tackle the constant changes in the digital sector with fun, fascination, and creativity to stay motivated and interested. I did some variations by adding it to the writing Style and flow of this work. That does not mean, that this was always the best way to do it. But I had the claim to add some Human creativity in the hope to figure out something awesome!
So again, this is not a scientific work! Itâ€™s my shot to make this new ground into my digital playground.
